Army Funding Hope

A crowdfunding platform to support soldiers and their families, built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

💡 Project Idea

There’s no dedicated or centralized system for civilians to contribute securely and transparently to army causes.
Army Funding Hope solves this by providing a trustworthy donation platform, where users can:

Register/Login securely
View causes & contribute donations
(Coming Soon) Admin dashboard to manage causes and funds
🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (Mongoose) + app scripts for store data local google sheets-
Payment Gateway: (Integration in progress)
